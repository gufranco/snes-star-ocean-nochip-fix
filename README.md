# Star Ocean, no chip: the header fix

neviksti took the S-DD1 out of Star Ocean. The header never noticed.

[![CI](https://github.com/gufranco/snes-star-ocean-nochip-fix/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gufranco/snes-star-ocean-nochip-fix/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**2** editions, **12** bytes changed per image and none elsewhere, **32** pinned digests across the two chains, **0** disagreements, **549** tests, **100%** statement and branch coverage, no dependencies

```bash
python3 starocean/verify.py   # reads only: says what is here and whether it is right
python3 starocean/fix.py      # confirms, corrects, confirms again, writes

#   japanese: -> dist/star-ocean-jp-nochip.sfc (4656c58a…)

#   english:  -> dist/star-ocean-en-nochip.sfc (3f0af092…)

#   2 of 2 corrected
```


## Install

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/gufranco/snes-star-ocean-nochip-fix.git
cd snes-star-ocean-nochip-fix
```

Python 3.12 or newer. Nothing else at runtime.

> [!IMPORTANT]

This package is not installable from an index and carries no `[project]` block,
because it consumes another member as a submodule rather than as a version range.

### Run it

You supply the files. Put whatever you have in [`roms/`](roms/) under the
filenames in [`roms/README.md`](roms/README.md), then ask what is there:

```bash
python3 starocean/verify.py roms dist
```

```
  japanese: source matches, Star Ocean (Japan).sfc
  japanese: patch absent, 96Mbit_SO_JPN.xdelta
  ...
```

That reads and writes nothing. When the image the correction consumes is present:

```bash
python3 starocean/fix.py roms dist
```

Both are run as files rather than as installed commands. This repository ships
no packaging block, because it consumes `snes-rom-image` as a submodule rather
than as a version range: a wheel built from here would install cleanly and then
raise on its first import, since the submodule is not in it and cannot be.

Point `STAR_OCEAN_ROM_DIR` at a library somewhere else to read from there
instead. A named directory wins even when it turns out to be empty, because
quietly falling back from a path somebody typed turns a typo into a run that
reports nothing needed doing.

## The interface

| Call | Does | Returns |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `look(where, editions, into)` | Reads every link of every chain and says what is there | `Finding` objects |
| `report(findings)` | Those findings as lines a person reads | strings |
| `verdict(findings)` | One word for the whole run | `sound`, `wrong` or `nothing` |
| `apply(image, edition)` | Corrects a supplied image and hands back the bytes | `bytes` |
| `confirm(data, expected)` | Whether a file is the one the manifest names | `bool` |
| `digests_of(data)` | All four digests of a buffer | a mapping |
| `named(name)` / `matching(digests)` | An edition, by name or by what a file turned out to be | an `Edition` |
| `run(where, into)` | The one that writes | an exit code |

`look` reads, `apply` corrects and hands back the bytes, and neither writes
anything.

```python
import tempfile

from starocean import EDITIONS, look, report, verdict

with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as nothing:
    found = look(nothing, EDITIONS, nothing)

    for line in report(found):
        print(line.split(",")[0].strip())
    print(verdict(found))
```

```
japanese: source absent
japanese: patch absent
japanese: reads absent
japanese: writes absent
english: source absent
english: patch absent
english: reads absent
english: writes absent
nothing
```

Pointed at a directory with nothing in it, every link of both chains reports
absent and the verdict is `nothing` rather than `wrong`. Those are different
answers on purpose: a run that found nothing to check is not a run that found
something broken.

The two editions, and what each chain starts from and ends at:

```python
from starocean import EDITIONS, EXPECTED_BYTES, named

for edition in EDITIONS:
    print(edition.name, edition.reads, "->", edition.writes)

print(named("english").size == EXPECTED_BYTES)
```

```
japanese Star Ocean (J) SDD1 Patched (Hack) v1 Neviksti.sfc -> star-ocean-jp-nochip.sfc
english Star Ocean (J) T+Eng, SDD1 Patched v1 DeJap, SDD1 v1 Neviksti.sfc -> star-ocean-en-nochip.sfc
True
```

Every file is confirmed against all four digests, not just the deciding one:

```python
from starocean import DECIDES, DIGESTS, digests_of

found = digests_of(b"not a cartridge")

print(DIGESTS)
print(DECIDES)
print(sorted(found) == sorted(DIGESTS))
```

```
('crc32', 'md5', 'sha1', 'sha256')
sha256
True
```

Publishing a crc32 beside a sha256 and never looking at the crc32 is publishing
decoration.

Everything the package raises lives in
[`starocean/errors.py`](starocean/errors.py) and nowhere else. There are six,
and they are separate classes because their fixes are separate: a file that is
not a file, one that matches nothing, one that matches a known bad dump, one that
is a cartridge but the wrong one, one that is absent, and a name no edition goes
by.

## Credit where it belongs

The hard part was done by other people, years ago, and none of it is repeated here.

| Who | What |
|:----|:-----|
| **neviksti** | Reverse-engineered the S-DD1 and wrote the [Star Ocean no S-DD1/96Mbit hack](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/614/): decompresses the graphics ahead of time and rebuilds the cartridge at 96 Mbit, so the chip is not needed at all. Two patches, one for the Japanese original and one for the translated build. |
| **DeJap Translations** | The English translation the second patch is built on. |

This repository changes twelve bytes of a header. That is the entire contribution, and the ratio is worth being clear about.

neviksti's stated purpose is worth repeating because it is exactly why the header matters: the hack is **for real hardware**. Backup units like the Game Doctor SF7, flash carts and custom carts have no S-DD1, so an unmodified Star Ocean will not run on them. A header still advertising a chip that is not fitted is a loose end on work aimed squarely at hardware that reads headers.

## What is wrong

Star Ocean shipped on an S-DD1 board. The chip decompressed graphics on the way to the console, which is how a 1996 cartridge fit a game that size. After the patch the data is already decompressed and the chip has nothing left to do.

Both rebuilds still say, in their header, that an S-DD1 is fitted.

| Field | Says | Should say |
|:------|:-----|:-----------|
| Chipset | `0x45`, S-DD1 with save memory | `0x00`, no coprocessor |
| Declared size | `0x0D`, eight megabytes | `0x0E`, the first power of two that holds twelve |
| Checksum | Covers the old fields | Covers the new ones |

The size was wrong before anyone touched the file. The field holds a power of two and there is no power of two at twelve, so the rebuild inherited a declaration that never matched it.

## The solution

Nothing here reimplements any of it. [`snes-mapper`](https://github.com/gufranco/snes-mapper-python) decides where the header sits, [`snes-rom-image`](https://github.com/gufranco/snes-rom-image-python) rewrites every mirror and recomputes the checksum, and this repository is the part that makes a small unattended change safe: it checks at both ends.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[image on disk] --> B{four digests<br/>match the manifest?}
    B -- no --> C[refused, nothing written]
    B -- yes --> D[rewrite every mirror<br/>recompute the checksum]
    D --> E{four more digests<br/>match the manifest?}
    E -- no --> C
    E -- yes --> F[written]
```

The order is the whole design. An image is confirmed before anything touches it, so a file that is not the one named never reaches the rewrite. The result is confirmed before it is written, so a rewrite that produced something unforeseen ends as a refusal rather than as a file on disk that looks finished.

## The two editions

The two patches are not interchangeable, which is why these are two editions rather than one with a flag.

| Edition | Starts from | Patch | Writes |
|:--------|:------------|:------|:-------|
| `japanese` | `Star Ocean (Japan).sfc` | `96Mbit_SO_JPN.xdelta` | `star-ocean-jp-nochip.sfc` |
| `english` | the same cartridge with DeJap's translation applied | `96Mbit_SO_ENG.xdelta` | `star-ocean-en-nochip.sfc` |

For the English chain the order matters and is neviksti's, not mine: apply DeJap's translation patch first and the 96 Mbit patch second. The other way round does not work.

## The whole chain is pinned, not just the ends

Pinning only the image the correction consumes tells you what to end up with and nothing about how. If you have the wrong file, the only thing it can say is "this is not the one named", when the useful answer is usually that the wrong patch was applied two steps earlier.

So every file between a cartridge you own and the image this writes carries four digests:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[retail cartridge] -->|neviksti's patch| B[96 Mbit rebuild]
    B -->|this repository| C[corrected image]
```

`verify.py` looks for all four links, reports each as absent, matching, altered or corrupt, and writes nothing. A report naming which link is wrong points at the step to redo.

Every filename and every digest lives in [`editions.manifest.json`](editions.manifest.json) and is printed in [`roms/README.md`](roms/README.md). The table is data rather than code: filenames and digests are the two things most likely to need a correction of their own, and a table nobody has to read Python to check is easier to correct.

## Why both ends are pinned

A correction whose output is not written down is a script, and a script that rewrites a header is indistinguishable from one that corrupts it. Both produce a file of exactly the right length.

So the manifest pins four digests of what goes in and four of what comes out. That buys three things:

- **A wrong input is caught before the rewrite.** A different revision of the patch produces a file of the right length and different content, and it would otherwise be corrected into something nobody has ever tested.
- **A changed correction is caught after it.** If the input was the one named and the output is not the one promised, something about the correction itself moved, and the run says so instead of writing.
- **A manifest that contradicts itself is caught either way.** All four digests are confirmed, not just the deciding one. Publishing a crc32 beside a sha256 and never looking at the crc32 is publishing decoration.

## What actually changes

Twelve bytes. Six per header mirror, and there are two mirrors, at `0x7FC0` and `0xA07FC0`.

```text
0x7FC0 + 0x16   chipset          0x45 -> 0x00
0x7FC0 + 0x17   declared size    0x0D -> 0x0E
0x7FC0 + 0x1C   complement       recomputed
0x7FC0 + 0x1E   checksum         recomputed
```

A test asserts that nothing outside a header mirror moves, so the claim is checked rather than stated. The game data the patch produced is not touched.

The manifest carries the digests of what goes in and what comes out, and beside
them the digests a superseded correction produced, with the reason it changed:

```python
from starocean import named

japanese = named("japanese")

print(japanese.before["sha256"][:16])
print(japanese.after["sha256"][:16])
```

```
e5ba9bef71c8ea31
4656c58a296b8901
```

An image matching the entry recorded under `supersedes` carries a checksum no
cartridge would. It was produced by this tool while the header reader below it
followed a rule that was wrong for an image whose length is not a power of two,
and both of these are twelve megabytes. Recording those digests beside the reason
is what turns "your file does not match" into "your file is one revision old".

## Is it right

```bash
python3 -m conformance.against_images
```

The real files, when they are here: every pinned digest, and that only header
mirrors move. It is skipped rather than passed when neither image is present, so
a run that proved nothing never reads as a run that proved something. CI attempts
it on every push and annotates the skip.

It runs the correction twice and compares what came out, because a correction
that is not idempotent is one nobody can safely re-run, and both runs write a
file of the right length.

[`conformance/hardware.json`](conformance/hardware.json) holds what this
correction asserts and where each assertion comes from.
[`conformance/divergences.json`](conformance/divergences.json) holds where a
source is weaker than it looks, and [`OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`](OPEN-QUESTIONS.md)
carries every place fidelity here is a claim rather than a measurement.

## Working on it

```bash
python3 -m coverage erase
for file in $(find starocean conformance -name '*.test.py' | sort); do
  python3 -m coverage run -a "$file"
done
python3 -m coverage report
```

Then the throughput floor, which runs outside the coverage step:

```bash
python3 -m conformance.speed
```

| Suite | File | Covers |
|:------|:-----|:-------|
| Editions | [`starocean/editions.test.py`](starocean/editions.test.py) | The manifest, digest widths, lookup by name and by digest |
| Fix | [`starocean/fix.test.py`](starocean/fix.test.py) | Correcting, confirming at both ends, every refusal, the command line |
| Verify | [`starocean/verify.test.py`](starocean/verify.test.py) | The four states, the verdict, and that nothing is ever written |
| Package | [`starocean/package.test.py`](starocean/package.test.py) | The exported surface, and that both commands resolve |
| Version | [`starocean/version.test.py`](starocean/version.test.py) | One version, in the file the release script writes |
| Images | [`conformance/against_images.test.py`](conformance/against_images.test.py) | The real files: every pinned digest, and that only header mirrors move |

The last one is skipped rather than passed when neither image is present, so a run that proved nothing never reads as a run that proved something. CI attempts it on every push and annotates the skip, and it runs the correction twice and compares what came out, because a correction that is not idempotent is one nobody can safely re-run and both runs write a file of the right length.

`python3 starocean/doctor.py` says what is actually on this machine: both editions, every link of both chains looked for on disk, and whether the submodule this repository needs is checked out. It is run as a file rather than with `-m` so that it still runs when the package itself will not import, which is the case it exists for. Its report is what an issue asks for, because a report is only as good as what it says about the machine that produced it.

A weekly job checks whether the vendored packages have moved and opens an issue if so. Taking them stays a deliberate act: a header reader that changes what it reads changes what every pinned digest means.


[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) is the document for an agent working here.
[`FAMILY.md`](FAMILY.md) is the standard this repository shares with the rest of
the family, kept identical in every member above the marker at the end of its

## References

| Package | Does |
|:--------|:-----|
| [`snes-rom-image`](https://github.com/gufranco/snes-rom-image-python) | Finds every header mirror, rewrites the fields, recomputes the checksum |
| [`snes-mapper`](https://github.com/gufranco/snes-mapper-python) | Decides where a header is, out of the places one can be |

Both are carried as submodules, each at the root of the repository that pulls it in and named after itself, so what this is built on is visible the moment either repository is opened. `snes-mapper-python` arrives nested inside `snes-rom-image-python`, which is why the clone above is recursive.

Fetching it is a command rather than an exercise. [`conformance/documents.json`](conformance/documents.json) carries the full digest, the byte count and a fetchable address, and [`conformance/documents.py`](conformance/documents.py) brings it down into `docs/`, which git ignores, and refuses anything whose digest does not match.

```bash
python3 -m conformance.documents          # fetch and verify the digest
python3 -m conformance.documents --check  # verify what is already here
